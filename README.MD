Currently, all files included in this repository are used for data capturing/rendering and processing. It is highly suggested that you should first try the code with all those default settings and parameters unchanged, especially for camera configurations. Once you get familiar with the pipeline gradually, then please feel free to modify the code for your own purpose.

The code of core algorithm and data used in our paper will be shared upon request, please drop me an email and let me know, thanks!
